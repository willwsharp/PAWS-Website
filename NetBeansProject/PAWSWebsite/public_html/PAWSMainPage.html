                The office is open from 9:00 a.m. to noon, and 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.,
                Monday through Friday.  We are closed from noon to 1 p.m. each day.

                <span class='genInfoSubtitles'>By Appointment Only</span><br>
                In order to allocate sufficient time for each client, it is 
                necessary to work by appointment only.  <b>Please do not</b> arrive at the
                office expecting to see me without an appointment.  When you call for
                an appointment, please give your name, the nature of your problem,
                and your telephone number, other information may also be requested.
                <br><br>
                <span class='genInfoSubtitles'>Appointment Cancellations</span><br>
                If you cannot keep an appointment, please give me reasonable notice.
                Your courtesy will enable me to make time available for another 
                client.
                <br><br>
                <span class='genInfoSubtitles'>Procedures</span><br>
                When you call the office it may not be possible to speak to me 
                immediately.  If I am in conference with a client, I will not 
                interrupt it to take calls.  I am often out of the office doing 
                research or attending court, so it is not possible for me to return
                telephone calls immediately.  Therefore, please give the necessary 
                information to my secretary.  In many instances she will be 
                familiar with your case.  If she cannot answer your questions, 
                she will confer with me and will return your call as soon as possible.
                <br>
                When calling the office to inquire about your case or ask questions,
                conserve your time and that of my secretary by consolidating your 
                questions for one call, rather than calling the office on each
                different question.
